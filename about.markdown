## What is Noke Codes?

Noke Codes is a civic-minded technology organization aimed at building a stronger community here in the Roanoke Valley through technology. We work to see technology leveraged in a way that allows all of the areaâ€™s residents to benefit from the opportunities it provides.

Our Mission:
Noke Codes is a tech focused organization that provides platforms connecting and educating Roanoke and its citizens with innovative opportunities.

Our Vision:
Promote Roanoke as a growing, connected community that effectively utilizes technology.

## What do we do?

We have hosted "Civic Hackathons" where the aim was to help area organizations and governments by connecting them with talented local technologists for a marathon session of problem-solving and programming. These were really fun events and has been a cornerstone of our work from the beginning.

Recent activities have been sponsoring other local events like the [BSides Roanoke](https://bsidesroa.org/) and the [Roanoke Raspberry Jam](https://roanokeraspberryjam.info/).

Lastly, we are actively working to create more educational opportunities for people throughout the region. One of our goals is to grow the number of talented technologists in the area and we believe we can help with this through educational offerings. We hope to share some such offerings with the community soon. We are always looking for new ways that technology can be used to benefit our community.
